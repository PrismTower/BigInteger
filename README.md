A simple, "single-file" and light-weighted C++ BigInteger Class.

The addition is about 4 times slower than GNU MP Library. 

The multiplication is implementation with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is about 20 times slower than GNU MP Library.

Including:

Basic overloaded operators

Montgomery Modular Multiplication

(Deterministic) Rabin-Miller Primality Test

Baillie-PSW Primality Test
