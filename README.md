A simple, "single-file" and light-weighted C++ BigInteger Class.

Addition operation is as fast as GNU MP Library. 

Multiplication operation is implementation with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is about 10 times slower than GNU MP Library.

Including:

Basic overloaded operators

Montgomery Modular Multiplication

(Deterministic) Rabin-Miller Primality Test

Baillie-PSW Primality Test
